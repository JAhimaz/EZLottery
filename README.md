What is EzLottery? EzLottery is a Spigot plugin built to add a new fun way for your users to spend their ingame money, each player purchases a certain amount of tickets (the more tickets the higher the chance), each ticket costs a certain amount, once the timer is up, a random ticket will be chosen and all the money will be given to that player! You can also add a tax system to send money to a ServerBank.
